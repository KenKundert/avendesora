To run these tests, run:

    py.tests

The current implementation is problematic in that it requires HOME to be 
overridden, which breaks the avendesora install, because python cannot find 
~/.local.

Probably need to override the config directory on the command line. Another 
possible choice would be to install avendesora inside tests/home.
