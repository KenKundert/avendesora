# Collections
#
# Provides common interface for dictionaries and lists. If a string is passed
# in, it is split and then treated as a list. Optimized for convenience rather
# than for large collections. Sorting versus the key is used to avoid randomness
# in the ordering of the dictionary-based collections.
