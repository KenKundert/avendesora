# Secrets
#
# Secret is a base class that can be used to easily generate various types of 
# secretes. Basically, it gathers together a collection of strings (the arguments 
# of the constructor and the generate function) that are joined together and 
# hashed. The 512 bit hash is then used to generate passwords, passphrases, and 
# other secrets.

class PasswordRecipe(MixedPassword):

    A version of MixedPassword where the requirements are specified with a short
    string rather than using the more flexible but more cumbersome method of
    MixedPassword. The string consists of a series of terms separated by white
    space. The first term is a number that specifies the total number of
    characters in the password. The remaining terms specify the number of
    characters that should be pulled from a particular class of characters. The
    classes are u (upper case letters), l (lower case letters), d (digits), s
    (punctuation), and c (an explicitly specified set of characters). For
    example, '12 2u 2d 2s' indicates that a 12 character password should be
    generated that includes 2 upper case letters, 2 digits, and 2 symbols. The
    remaining characters will be chosen from the base character set, which by
    default is the set of alphanumeric characters.

    The c class is special in that it allow you to explicitly specify the
    characters to use. For example, '12 2c!@#$%^&=' directs that a 12 character
    password be generated, 2 of which are taken from the set !@#$%^&=.
