# Secrets
#
# Secret is a base class that can be used to easily generate various types of 
# secretes. Basically, it gathers together a collection of strings (the arguments 
# of the constructor and the generate function) that are joined together and 
# hashed. The 512 bit hash is then used to generate passwords, passphrases, and 
# other secrets.

    For year, enter the year the entry that contains BirthDate was created.  
    Doing so anchors the age range. In this example, the creation date is 2015,
    the minimum age is 18 and the maximum age is 65, meaning that a birthdate
    will be chosen such that in 2015 the birth date could correspond to someone
    that is between 18 and 65 years old.

    You can use the fmt argument to change the way in which the date is 
    formatted::

    >>> secret = BirthDate(2015, 18, 65, fmt="M/D/YY")
    >>> secret.generate('dux', None, account)
    >>> str(secret)
    '9/21/94'
