# One-Time Passwords
#
# GeneratedSecret is a base class that can be used to easily generate various
# types of secretes. Basically, it gathers together a collection of strings (the
# arguments of the constructor and the generate function) that are joined
# together and hashed. The 512 bit hash is then used to generate passwords,
# passphrases, and other secrets.

        Generates a secret that changes over time that generally is used
        as a second factor when authenticating.  It can act as a replacement
        for, and is fully compatible with, Google Authenticator or Authy.  You
        would provide the text version of the shared secret that is presented to
        you when first configuring your second factor authentication. See
        :ref:`otp` for more information.
